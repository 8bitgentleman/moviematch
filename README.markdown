## What is this?

Have you ever spent longer deciding on a movie than it'd take to just watch a random movie? This is an app that helps you and your friends pick a movie to watch from a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) server.

## How it works

MovieMatch connects to your Plex server and gets a list of movies (from any libraries marked as a movie library).

As many people as you want connect to your MovieMatch server and get a list of shuffled movies. Swipe right to üëç, swipe left to üëé.

If two (or more) people swipe right on the same movie, it'll show up in everyone's matches. The movies that the most people swiped right on will show up first.

## Getting started

### With Docker

`docker run -it -e PLEX_URL=https://plex.example.com -e PLEX_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> -p 8000:8000 lukechannings/moviematch`

### Running manually

- Install [Deno](https://deno.land)
- Set up a `.env` file (or set env vars directly by prefixing `env PLEX_URL=...` to the following command)
- Run `deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env src/index.ts`

## Configuration

The following variables are supported via a `.env` file or environment variables.

## Q&A

### Can a user get my Plex Token?

No. The client never talks directly to the Plex server and any requests that need the token (e.g. querying movies, getting poster art) are made by the server.

Furthermore, only a subset of the Plex response is given to the client to minimise the chance of sensitive information leaking out.

### Can it do TV shows too?

You can try setting `SECTION_TYPE_FILTER=show`, but I cannot guarantee it'll work.

### Do you gather any data?

No. The server is entirely local to you and will work offline.

### Do you support languages other than English?

Yes. The server will use your browser's preferred language by default if it's supported. Otherwise it'll fall back to English.

The translations can be found [in the i18n folder](./i18n).

The file names follow [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) naming. Feel free to submit a Pull Request if you'd like your language to be supported.
